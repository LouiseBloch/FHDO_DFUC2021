# FHDO_DFUC2021
This repository holds code snippets to be provided alongside with submissions from team FHDO to the DFUC 2021 (https://dfu-2021.grand-challenge.org/), associated with the MICCAI 2021 (https://www.miccai2021.org/). A paper on the used dataset is available on arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03068). Further information on the challenge can be looked up on its GitHub page (https://dfu-challenge.github.io/).

Thus, the code snippets may not be of use for anyone else than the challenge hosts. After announcement of the challenge results have been published on 15 August 2021, this repository will be closed and potentially re-opened later in favor of a less specific and more tidy code base.

The following submissions were sent in, relying on the snippets:
* Submission: base_effnet_ensemble
* Submission: pseudogan_effnetB0
* Submission: pseudogan_effnetB1
* Submission: pseudogan_effnetB2
* Submission: pseudogan_effnet_ensemble

Weights and predictions can be obtained from the stated Sciebo cloud storage (https://fh-dortmund.sciebo.de/s/54GwIg5STDSn0fl) using the password provided alongside with the supplementary information.

The challenge hosts may please not hesitate to contact team FHDO in case they are facing problems working with the provided solutions.
